# Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration:

A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly

This project is a visualization dashboard that displays
information and insights from the Phonepe pulse Github repository in an interactive
and visually appealing manner. 

The data
will be stored in a MySQL database for efficient retrieval and the dashboard will be
dynamically updated to reflect the latest data.


Users will be able to access the dashboard from a web browser and easily navigate
the different visualizations and facts and figures displayed. 

The dashboard will
provide valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe pulse
Github repository, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and decision-making.


Overall, the result of this project will be a comprehensive and user-friendly solution
for extracting, transforming, and visualizing data from the Phonepe pulse Github
repository.

 By leveraging Python libraries like pandas, Streamlit, Plotly, and SQLAlchemy, along with a MySQL database, users can explore various metrics related to transaction volume, types, and geographical distribution.

## Lessons Learned

Python scripting, Data Collection, Streamlit, Plotly, Data Management using SQL

1. Data extraction and processing: You will learn how to use Clone Github to
extract data from a repository and pre-process the data using Python libraries
such as Pandas.

2. Database management: You will learn how to use a relational database such
as MySQL to store data and retrieve it efficiently for analysis and visualization.

3. Visualization and dashboard creation: You will learn how to use libraries
such as Streamlit and Plotly to create interactive and visually appealing
dashboards for data visualization.

4. Geo visualization: You will learn how to create and display data on a map
using Plotly's built-in geo map functions.

5. Dynamic updating: You will learn how to create a dashboard that
dynamically updates based on the latest data in a database.

6. Project development and deployment: You will learn how to develop a
comprehensive and user-friendly solution, from data extraction to dashboard
deployment. You will also learn how to test and deploy the solution to ensure it
is secure, efficient, and user-friendly.
